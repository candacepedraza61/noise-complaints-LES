    <h1> Lower East Side deals with noise, quality of life effected by Open Streets </h1>
      <h2> by Candace Pedraza </h2>
        <h3> Open Streets and Restaurants in New York City are a new addition to our public space landscape born of pandemic-necessary restrictions. But they've led to a rise in noise complaints by residents and officials. There are several factors we can contribute to this rise in noise complaints in an area that truly lends itself to the famous New York City slogan, "the city that never sleeps:" </h3>

            <div class="text">Open Streets has allowed for biking and foot traffic to become more commonplace over the weekend on Orchard Street in the LES due to street closures. Chinatown CORE, a block association in CB3, says that these street closures would lead to lack of accessibility for their senior, low-income residents who rely on Access-a-Ride.</div>

        <div class="text">Open Restaurants have allowed for businesses to use public space for their own private dining areas. There is a curfew in place for this outdoor dining: 10 PM. However, there have been several violations of this curfew by establishments in the LES. One in particular, Clockwork, was denied a liquor license for a new bar last month due to their curfew-breaking. </div>

        <div class="text">Open Streets call for the closure of specific blocks on Fridays and Saturdats to motorists. Most recently, Orchard Street hosted a live jazz band along with an arts and crafts event on September 11th, 2021. While these events are supported by some local block associations like the Loisaida Block Association, others like Marcell Rocha of Orchard Street Block Association have said these events have caused limitations in the ability of the NYPD to respond to complaints and issues in the neighborhood.</div>

          <img src="loudmusic.png" alt="a boombox playing music"></div>
          <div class="text">The largest culprit of these complaints are from bars and restaurants in the LES. While  loud venues have been commonplace in the Lower East Side for years, the amount of new businesses that attract a tourist-y crowd has increased significantly, and many have racked up complaints that the NYPD have found hard to respond to. Open Streets and Restaurant "huts" make it even harder for law enforcement to respond to complaints. </div>

          <li> Community Board 3 has offered instructions on their website to submit noise complaints tied to nightlife. You can access that information <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/html/mancb3/html/sla/nightlife.shtml"> here. </li>

          <li> <a href="https://downtownny.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lower-Manhattan-Bike-Report-2020.pdf"> This study conducted by Downtown Alliance </a> also shows how biking is most popular in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where CB3 is located. </li>

          <li> <a href="https://www.boweryboogie.com/2020/08/unequal-opportunity-for-mott-street-open-restaurants-op-ed/"> This story </a>in the Bowery Boogie speaks on the "missed opportunity" by Councilwoman Margaret Chin to support an Open Streets program on Mott Street in Chinatown. Opposition came from Chin as well as businesses in the area. It would also lead to accessibility issues for the low-income seniors that rely on Access-a-Ride in the neighborhood, according to Jan Lee of Chinatown CORE.</li>
